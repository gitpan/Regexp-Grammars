    * Various doc tweaks

    * Removed intermittent "uninitialized" warnings

    * Added warning when no main regex specified

    * Refined error message status indicators (now only errors get an

    * Fixed exponentiation associativity for demo_calc (thanks Schwern!)

    * Fixed bug in charset parsing (thanks Dave!)

    * Removed false error messages regarding explicitly use of built-in
      <ws> and <hk> rules

    * Fixed bug with negative lookaheads that incorporate subrule calls

    * Localized $/ during debugger interactions

    * Added <objrule: Class::Name=rulename> variation to allow distinct
      "internal" and "external" names for objrules and objtokens
      (thanks Casiano)
    
    * Fixed handling of (?#...) comments (thanks Casiano)

    * Added pure grammar definitions: <grammar: NAME>

    * Added inheritance from grammar definitions: <extends: NAME>

    * Added fully qualified subrule calls to allow derived rules to call
      base rules: <Base::Class::rulename>



1.005  Tue Jun 22 05:41:35 2010

    * Tweaked internals to allow matches against stringifying objects,
      without nasty warnings

    * Extended demo/calc* to allow negatives outside parens (thanks Steven)

    * Pod tweaks (thanks Carl)

    * Added autoaction callbacks

    * Made @! contents unique (no more duplicates due to backtracking retries)

    * Made <MATCH=...> work in the top-level pattern of a grammar

    * Added set_context_width() to allow width of context string column 
      to be adjusted either permanently or within a scope. (Thanks Daniel)

    * Added l10n feature for <error:...> and <warning:...> directives
      (thanks Aki!)

    * Added <minimize:> directive

    * Fixed debugging directives in grammars
