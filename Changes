    * Fixed mishandling of (??{....}) blocks

    * Various doc tweaks

    * Removed intermittent "uninitialized" warnings

    * Added warning when no main regex specified

    * Documented more explicitly that start-pattern is supposed to act
      like a regular regex (or a token) wrt to whitespace



1.011  Sun Oct 10 18:57:10 2010

    * Added <!RULENAME> as alias for: (?! <.RULENAME> )

    * Improved description of <error:...> directive to make it clearer 
      that errors manifest in @! variable (thanks Leigh)

    * Added t/error_non_backtracking.t and
      demo/demo_error_nonbacktracking.pl to demonstrate use of (*COMMIT)
      to optimize error messages (thanks Nicolas)

    * Removed undocumented dependency of test suite on Class::Accessor
      (thanks Duff)

    * Tweaked caveats section to reflect improvements both in module

      (Thanks Peng)

    * Corrected docs for <debug: on>
      (Thanks Peng)

    * Made Latin-1 encoding of docs explicit


1.022  Tue Jan 22 18:39:16 2013
