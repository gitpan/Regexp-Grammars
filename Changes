    * Various doc tweaks

    * Removed intermittent "uninitialized" warnings

    * Added warning when no main regex specified

      <ws> and <hk> rules

      (thanks Casiano)
    
    * Fixed handling of (?#...) comments (thanks Casiano)

    * Added pure grammar definitions: <grammar: NAME>

    * Added inheritance from grammar definitions: <extends: NAME>

      base rules: <Base::Class::rulename>



1.005  Tue Jun 22 05:41:35 2010

    * Tweaked internals to allow matches against stringifying objects,
      without nasty warnings

    * Extended demo/calc* to allow negatives outside parens (thanks Steven)

    * Pod tweaks (thanks Carl)

    * Added autoaction callbacks

    * Made @! contents unique (no more duplicates due to backtracking retries)

    * Made <MATCH=...> work in the top-level pattern of a grammar

    * Added set_context_width() to allow width of context string column 
      to be adjusted either permanently or within a scope. (Thanks Daniel)

      (thanks Aki!)

    * Added <minimize:> directive

    * Fixed debugging directives in grammars

      (thanks Andrew).

      like a regular regex (or a token) wrt to whitespace
