       Initial public release.


1.001_004  Sun Aug  2 23:08:52 2009

    * Fixed mishandling of (??{....}) blocks

    * Attempted to patch around three-way bug with lexicals in regexes
      (further testing may be required to ensure patch is effective

1.002  Tue Dec  8 21:30:11 2009

    * Various doc tweaks

    * Removed intermittent "uninitialized" warnings

    * Added warning when no main regex specified

    * Refined error message status indicators (now only errors get an
      indicator for every separate message; info is consolidated)

    * Fixed exponentiation associativity for demo_calc (thanks Schwern!)

    * Fixed bug in charset parsing (thanks Dave!)

    * Removed false error messages regarding explicitly use of built-in
      <ws> and <hk> rules

    * Fixed bug with negative lookaheads that incorporate subrule calls

    * Localized $/ during debugger interactions

    * Added <objrule: Class::Name=rulename> variation to allow distinct
      "internal" and "external" names for objrules and objtokens
      (thanks Casiano)
    
    * Fixed handling of (?#...) comments (thanks Casiano)

    * Added pure grammar definitions: <grammar: NAME>

    * Added inheritance from grammar definitions: <extends: NAME>

    * Added fully qualified subrule calls to allow derived rules to call
      base rules: <Base::Class::rulename>



1.005  Tue Jun 22 05:41:35 2010

    * Tweaked internals to allow matches against stringifying objects,
      without nasty warnings

    * Extended demo/calc* to allow negatives outside parens (thanks Steven)

    * Pod tweaks (thanks Carl)

    * Added autoaction callbacks

    * Made @! contents unique (no more duplicates due to backtracking retries)

    * Made <MATCH=...> work in the top-level pattern of a grammar

    * Added set_context_width() to allow width of context string column 
      to be adjusted either permanently or within a scope. (Thanks Daniel)

    * Added l10n feature for <error:...> and <warning:...> directives
      (thanks Aki!)

    * Added <minimize:> directive

    * Fixed debugging directives in grammars

    * Added per-hash key patterns to <%HASH>  (Thanks Aki)

    * Added </IDENT> inverserefs


1.008  Fri Sep 17 20:53:31 2010

    * Pod nits denitted (thanks Christopher)

    * Added builtin <matchpos> and <matchline> subrules

    * Added documentation warning about non-reentrancy of Perl 5 regex engine
      (thanks Andrew).

    * Fixed behaviour of ** repetitions wrt whitespace (thanks Andrew)

    * Documented more explicitly that start-pattern is supposed to act
      like a regular regex (or a token) wrt to whitespace



1.011  Sun Oct 10 18:57:10 2010

    * Added <!RULENAME> as alias for: (?! <.RULENAME> )

    * Added <?RULENAME> as alias for: (?= <.RULENAME> ) 
      (and made it work around normal lookahead/capture problem)

    * Fixed major bugs in <:arg> handling


1.012  Wed Nov  3 20:24:36 2010

    * Added RFC5322 example (thanks Tom and Abigail!)

    * Added <:nocontext> and <:context> directives to optimize
      away unwanted context substrings.

    * Solved transitive inheritance problem
      (grammars now fully polymorphic)

    * Added NEXT:: namespace for generic polymorphism


1.013  Wed Jun 29 14:39:40 2011

    * Improved in-doc calculator example (thanks Jake!)

    * Improved RFC5322 example (thanks Tom and Abigail)

    * Added <timeout:...> directive (thanks Dan)

    * Added <fatal:...> directive

    * Added better compile-time debugging of standard Perl subpatterns

    * Added documentation of problems when using objrules
      whose ctors re-invoke the regex engine (thanks Nathan)

    * Added new tests for objrules whose classes are based
      on Moose or autoloading (thanks Nathan!)


1.014  Wed Nov  2 13:57:09 2011

    * Improved description of <error:...> directive to make it clearer 
      that errors manifest in @! variable (thanks Leigh)

    * Added t/error_non_backtracking.t and
      demo/demo_error_nonbacktracking.pl to demonstrate use of (*COMMIT)
      to optimize error messages (thanks Nicolas)

    * Removed undocumented dependency of test suite on Class::Accessor
      (thanks Duff)

    * Tweaked caveats section to reflect improvements both in module
      (grammar inheritance now fully polymorphic) and in Perl 5.14
      regexes (regexes now reentrant)

    * Fixed problem with \N{NAMED CHARS} under 5.12 and later (thanks Tom!)

    * Added *% +% and {n,m}% separated repetitions to track the
      Perl 6 feature



1.015  Wed Feb 29 12:37:25 2012

    * Enabled limited support for tracking raw regex components when
      debugging a grammar (mainly literals and backslashed
      metacharacters)

    * Fixed bug that prevented named subpattern captures from including 
      lookbehinds (e.g. <name=( (?<!foo) bar )> didn't work)
